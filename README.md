# API Definition

API Definition repository

## Fast run

 * Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).
 * Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the repo root.
 * Run `npm run api-doc`
 * Open the `./docs/index.html` in your favorite browser

## Generating the API Documentation with ReDoc

We used ReDoc CLI to generate the documentation from the API specification in our `.yml` file, so we installed `redoc-cli` like a development dependency in our project:

```
npm run redoc-blundle
```

ReDoc take the specification in our OpenAPI document and create an `index.html` file with the page with the documentation and place it into the `/docs` folder.

You can go to the `/docs` folder and open the `index.html` file in a browser and see how ReDoc has converted our plain specification in a great API documentation

## Automating the Documentation

We didnâ€™t like to have to execute the command all times to see the changes in the API specification, so we configured our project to serve the documentation in a site and keeps the documentation updated while we modify the API definition in our specification file.

So, finally to make easy the documentation work you have to execute:

```
npm run api-doc
```

## Test the Specification

To test the specification we use the [OpenAPI CLI toolset](https://github.com/Redocly/openapi-cli) developed by the Redockly team.

To execute it, you only have to execute the following command:

```
npm run test
```

## Create the `dist` Folder

Execute:

```
npm run build
```

## Clean the Environment

Execute:

```
npm run clean
```
